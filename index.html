    <h2> <u>Who Am I?</u>
        <h3>My name is Benjamin. I'm currently taking a Computer Programming class and this is our first project. I'm obviously not going to give away too much information about myself on the internet because that would be a horrible idea.</h3>

    <h2><a href="my_hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a></h2>
    <h3><u>Music:</u></h3>
    <h4>I've played guitar for about 10 whole years now, and I'm still taking lessons to this day. I was at a Conservatory of Music near me for about 7 years before I decided to leave. I also have played piano for about 8 or so years, having weekly lessons to improve. Even though I've just started high school, I have already taken the AP Music Theory and got a 5 on it and now am taking college level music theory classes.</h4>
    <h3><u>Video Games:</u></h3>
    <h4>I have played a plethora of different games and I especially like the very difficult ones. The first very difficult game that I 100%ed (or in this case 112%ed) was Hollow Knight. I then moved on to an even harder game being Elden Ring (all of these games I have 100%ed, meaning that I have seen and done everything that you can do in all of these games including getting all of the achievements etc.) Then I decided that I would 100% all of the souls games. So I went on my journey, going through Dark Souls, then Dark Souls II, then Dark Souls III, then moving on to Bloodborne then Lies of P and finally moving on to the hardest of them all, Sekiro. I have also set a few video game world records, some still standing, some being dethroned within a week, including:
        <h5><u>Super Mario Odyssey:</u></h5>
        <h6>Darker Side 1.3 Speedrun World Record,<p>Minimum Captures% (former)</p></h6>
        <h5><u>Celeste:</u></h5>
        <h6>Farewell Golden Berry + Moon Berry 3 times in a row, <p>202 Berries Deathless (second ever)</p></h6>
        <h5><u>Hollow Knight:</u></h5>
        <h6>Pantheons 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 all bindings as well as colo 1, 2, 3, all hitless, all in a row (first ever) <p>Spelless% (former)</p></h6>
