    <h4>I've played guitar for about 11 whole years now, and I'm still taking lessons to this day. I was at a Conservatory of Music near me for about 7 years before I decided to leave. I also have played piano for about 9 or so years, having weekly lessons to improve. Even though I've just started high school, I have already taken the AP Music Theory and got a 5 on it and now am taking college level music theory classes.</h4>

    <h4>I have played a plethora of different games and I especially like the very difficult ones. The first very difficult game that I 100%ed (or in this case 112%ed) was Hollow Knight. I then moved on to an even harder game being Elden Ring (all of these games I have 100%ed, meaning that I have seen and done everything that you can do in all of these games including getting all of the achievements etc.) Then I decided that I would 100% all of the souls games. So I went on my journey, going through Dark Souls, then Dark Souls II, then Dark Souls III, then moving on to Bloodborne then Lies of P and finally moving on to the hardest of them all, Sekiro. I have also set a few video game world records, some still standing, some being dethroned within a week, including:
        <h5><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Odyssey:</a></u></h5>
        <h6>Darker Side 1.3 Speedrun World Record,<p>Minimum Captures% (former)</p></h6>
        <h5><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celeste:</a></u></h5>
